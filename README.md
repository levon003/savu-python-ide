Savu, Python IDE
===============

Savu, a Python IDE for beginning programmers.
A team of six undergraduate students worked for 20 weeks to develop a
beginner's IDE that could function as an introduction to IDEs for beginning
CS students at Carleton College. It hopes to marry the low learning curve
of the standard text editors in use at Carleton (TextWrangler, Sublime Text 2)
with a few of the advanced features introduced by IDEs like Eclipse.
